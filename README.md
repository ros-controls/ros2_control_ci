This repository holds reusable workflows for CI of the ros2_control framework as well as weekly updated docker images for building the ros2_control stack on different platforms, supporting all current releases as by [REP-2000](https://ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html).
They are automatically built and pushed to the [GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)](https://github.com/orgs/ros-controls/packages/container/package/ros) and can be used as base images for building the ros2_control stack.

Within this repo the full ros2_control stack is built and tested once per day.

## Compatibility versions
We thrive to make the rolling development version of the ros2_control stack compatible with earlier releases of ROS 2. This is done by building the rolling version of the stack from source with the earlier releases of ROS 2.

## ros2_ubuntu
Extension of the [official OSRF docker images](https://github.com/osrf/docker_images), but with versions for `ros2`(main) and `ros2-testing` binaries.

## ros2_rhel
This is a sample Dockerfile that show ros2 installed on almalinux based on the [binary installation instructions at docs.ros.org](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation/RHEL-Install-RPMs.html). The most recent public build can be found with the docker tag: `ghcr.io/ros-controls/ros:<ROS_DISTRO>-rhel` where `<ROS_DISTRO>` is replaced with the ros distribution you are targeting.

The image tries to emulate the official ros2 images but on alma (downstream RHEL) linux. Therefore a few extra packages can be found within this repo that are not mentioned at the above link, i.e. colcon, etc.

## ros2_debian
Provides docker images for building ros2_control on debian.

Pull and run the images with:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ros-controls/ros:rolling-debian
docker run -it ghcr.io/ros-controls/ros:rolling-debian bash
```

To manually build them, you can use the following commands:
```bash
docker build -t ros2_debian11_humble . -f Dockerfile.debian11 --build-arg ROS_DISTRO=humble
docker build -t ros2_debian12_jazzy . -f Dockerfile.debian12 --build-arg ROS_DISTRO=jazzy
docker build -t ros2_debian12_rolling . -f Dockerfile.debian12 --build-arg ROS_DISTRO=rolling
```
